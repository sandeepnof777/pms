<p><strong>11. TERMINATION</strong></p>
<p>(A) We reserve the right in our sole discretion and at any time to terminate or suspend your Membership and/or block your access to the Website for any reason including, without limitation if you have failed to comply with the letter and spirit of these Terms of Use. You agree that RI shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination or suspension of your Membership or for blocking your access to the Website.<br>(B) Your right to use the Website, Services, and Content automatically terminates if you violate this Agreement or any rules or guidelines posted in connection with the Website. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of any of the Website, for any reason, with or without notice.<br>(C) Any suspension or termination shall not affect your obligations to us under these Terms of Use. The provisions of these Terms of Use which by their nature should survive the suspension or termination of your Membership or these Terms of Use shall survive including, but not limited to the rights and licenses that you have granted hereunder, indemnities, releases, disclaimers, limitations on liability, provisions related to choice of law, dispute resolution, no class action, no trial by jury and all of the miscellaneous provisions in Section 17.</p>
<p><strong>12. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Any legal proceedings against RI that may arise out of, relate to, or be in any way connected with our Website or these Terms of Use shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of Cincinnati, Ohio and you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</p>
<p><strong>13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>In the Dispute Resolution Section only, “we” and “us” are used to refer to you and RI together.<br>(A) We each agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a written description of the problem, all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution. You agree to contact us with disputes by contacting us at the address provided in these Terms of Use. We will contact you based on the contact information you have provided us.<br>(B) We each agree to finally settle all disputes (as defined and subject to any specific exceptions below) only by arbitration. In arbitration, there’s no judge or jury and review is limited. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the Terms of Use and can award the same damages and relief. The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. We each also agree as follows:</p>
<p>(1) “Disputes” are any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to the Website, Website Content or these Terms of Use – this includes claims you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates or other representatives, and claims RI may bring against you.</p>
<p>(2) If either of us wants to arbitrate a dispute, we agree to send written notice to the other providing a description of the dispute, previous efforts to resolve the dispute, all supporting documents/information, and the proposed resolution. We will send notice to you based on the contact information you have provided us and notice to us must be sent to: mike@<?php echo SITE_EMAIL_DOMAIN;?> We agree to make attempts to resolve the dispute. If we cannot resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate, then we may submit the dispute to formal arbitration.&nbsp; At no times prior to this resolution can either side publicly in blogs, online chat forums, reviews of any sort etc identify any negative issue of wither party until the dispute resolution has been conducted.</p>
<p>(3) The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree the FAA’s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>(4) The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its arbitration rules. If any AAA rule conflicts with these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use apply. You can obtain procedures, rules, and fee information from the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 1 or www.adr.org.</p>
<p>(5) The Arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and will take place in Cincinnati, Ohio. The federal or state law that applies to these Terms of Use will also apply during the arbitration.</p>
<p>(6) We each agree not to pursue arbitration on a classwide basis. We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and RI (not brought on behalf of or together with another individual’s claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn’t apply and the dispute must be brought in court.</p>
<p>(7) We each are responsible for our respective costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, as well as any other costs relating to the arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>14. NO CLASS ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
<p><strong>15. NO TRIAL BY JURY</strong></p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;16. AMENDMENT; ADDITIONAL TERMS</strong></p>
<p>(A) We reserve the right in our sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, to modify or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Website or our services or to modify these Terms of Use. In addition, we reserve the right to provide you with operating rules or additional terms that may govern your use of the Website generally, unique parts of the Website, or both (“Additional Terms”). Any Additional Terms that we may provide to you will be incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use. To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms of Use, the Additional Terms will control. We also reserve the right to modify our prices for our services, including searches, at any time and for any reason.<br>(B) Modifications to these Terms of Use or Additional Terms will be effective immediately upon notice, either by posting on the Website or by notification by email or conventional mail. It is your responsibility to review the Terms of Use and the Website from time to time for any changes or Additional Terms. Your access and use of any the Website following any modification of these Terms of Use or the provision of Additional Terms will signify your assent to and acceptance of the same. If you object to any subsequent revision to the Terms of Use or to any Additional Terms, immediately discontinue use of the Website and, if applicable, terminate your Membership.</p>
<p><strong>17. MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>
<p>(A) No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect.<br>(B) These Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter.<br>(C) You may not assign these Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. Any such purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent will be null and void and of no force and effect. We may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent and without notice.<br>(D) You agree that any material breach of Sections 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to RI for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, RI will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if RI seeks such an injunction. Rights and obligations under this Agreement, which, by their nature, should survive will remain in full effect after termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p></div>
