    <p><strong>Just a couple more steps...</strong></p>

    <p>
        Now that you've downloaded the QWC file, we need to run it once to make sure we have the information
        that we need to be able to sync your contacts and turn proposals into invoices.

    <p>
        If you are being asked for a password - yours is
        <span style="font-weight: bold; background: #e2e2e2; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 1.2em;"><?php echo $qbd_pass; ?></span>.
        Enter the password and update the <?php echo SITE_NAME;?> Web Service.
    </p>
